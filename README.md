# Python Data Processing Projects

This repository contains Python-based data processing projects implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and the Pandas library. These projects demonstrate common data manipulation and analysis techniques applicable to various domains.

* **Project 1: Standing Cost Average Calculation:** This project calculates the average standing cost from energy consumption data. It involves loading and preprocessing meter point reference number (MPRN) data, generating a calendar of billing periods, and accurately calculating the average standing charge component. It demonstrates data manipulation, date handling, and aggregation techniques.
* **Project 2: DUoS Band Extraction:** This project extracts Distribution Use of System (DUoS) band information from an Excel file. It parses the file to identify and extract the relevant DUoS band values and associated time periods. It showcases techniques for working with Excel file structures and extracting specific tariff-related data.

These projects highlight practical data processing workflows.
